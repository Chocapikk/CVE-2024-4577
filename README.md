## Personal Note on Public Disclosure üìò

I released my code publicly to address the irresponsible ways critical vulnerabilities are often disclosed. People have already shared the correct method to exploit this vulnerability, but many are still publishing flawed or fabricated exploits for attention. Additionally, media outlets tend to create unnecessary fear by broadcasting incorrect or unverified claims. This misleads everyone from the people who need to patch systems to researchers, and it negatively impacts the defensive side of cybersecurity. The lack of accuracy and accountability in these practices is very troubling to me.
